	Medicine Tracker (tm) is a mobile application for the Android phones that helps keep track of medications a user has. 
	The app uses online connection to connect to the database to store, and retrieve information. The alarm is set locally on the phone. Since our application is hosted on a free website hosting app, our website goes down at 11pm PST for about 1 hour a day. It may vary on different times if the website host changes it because of overload on their servers. 
	
	Our program is on github: https://github.com/SalgueroRoci/Med
	Our website is: https://medicinetracker.000webhostapp.com/
	
	Website source files are under the 'website' folder. The database used on the website is in the '/website/database' folder. 
	The createtables.sql is the structure of our database and currentdata.sql is the current data in the database as of 12/03/17.
	All other android source files are under the Med project file including xml and java files. (Med/app/src/main/java/edu/fullerton/teamobile/med/)
